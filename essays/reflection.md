## Learning Beyond Self-Taught Development

Before ICS 314, I already had experience developing web applications using a modern technology stack, including frameworks like Next.js and React. However, most of my learning was self-directed, and while I could build functional projects, there were significant gaps in my understanding. This course gave me the opportunity to learn software engineering in a structured and systematic way. Through the lectures, readings, and hands-on assignments, I was able to revisit familiar concepts and patch the knowledge gaps I previously worked around. More importantly, I gained insight into software engineering practices that extend far beyond web development.

## Understanding Agile and Issue Driven Project Management
One of the most important concepts I learned was Agile Project Management, particularly a method called Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM). Agile Project Management is a team-based approach to software development that emphasizes short development cycles, regular feedback, and adaptability. IDPM takes this a step further by organizing tasks as issues in GitHub. Each issue is tied to a specific branch, pull request, and commit, which creates a clear and trackable workflow. During our group project, we used IDPM to coordinate responsibilities and manage deadlines.

## Practicing Version Control
Another key topic I learned was Configuration Management, which refers to the systematic handling of changes in a software system. Tools like Git support this by enabling developers to track modifications, manage different versions, and collaborate without overwriting each others' work. I had used Git before this course, but not in a disciplined way. Through the assignments and team project, I learned how to use branches, pull requests, and code reviews correctly. These skills are essential for any serious software project and are just as relevant outside of web development.

## Appreciating Coding Standards
Lastly, I gained a new appreciation for Coding Standards, which are shared guidelines that help developers write consistent and maintainable code. In our projects, we followed style rules and used tools like ESLint and Prettier to automatically enforce them. Although they were a pain to deal with in the beginning, I realized that having a common standard made it easier for team members to understand each other's work and reduced friction during reviews. Good coding practices are not just helpful for web development; they are necessary in any team-based or long-term project where readability and maintainability matter.

## My Final Thoughts
In summary, although I came into this course with some experience, I leave with a much clearer understanding of software engineering as a discipline. I have learned how to manage a team project using Agile methods, how to properly use configuration management tools, and how to follow coding standards that promote collaboration and quality. These skills are broadly applicable and will stay with me no matter what kind of software I build in the future.
