## The Frustrations of UI Development

UI development is always frustrating. You can spend an hour trying to adjust the padding or sizing of a container just to realize that an icon inside of it is affecting the sizing. Something particularly frustrating is when your layout looks perfect on your screen but completely breaks on mobile. Even small misalignments just a few pixels off can take an unjust amount of time to debug.

## My Early Experiences

In high school, I had my first experiences with web development. We focused on learning how to use HTML and CSS. At the time, I thought I had it figured out. I was able to create pages with headers, paragraphs, buttons, and CSS animations. Granted, my pages didn’t look anything close to professional web pages, but it seemed good enough for a beginner. I was told these were valuable skills, and I believed that when I’d work on a project in the future, I’d be able to apply them with no problems.

However, that assumption was shattered in my freshman year of college. I joined the ACM Manoa Software Development team to get some experience collaborating with others on projects. My first task was to improve the frontend of an attendance tracker. When I cloned the repository and opened the code, I was completely lost. It looked nothing like the HTML and CSS I had learned in high school. I saw nested components, class names with no meaning, and what looked like JavaScript mixed in. My brain was overwhelmed and so I saw everything as gibberish. I later learned that the project was built with Next.js, and the UI was styled using Bootstrap 5. Thankfully, they assigned me very basic tasks like resizing an icon, but I realized that just relying on my traditional HTML and CSS skills wasn’t sustainable. There was an entirely different way of frontend development that I had never encountered before. 

## My Recent Learnings

Recently, in my ICS 314 Software Engineering class, I officially learned Bootstrap 5. There was a massive difference. The week before, I struggled creating layouts using raw HTML and CSS because I had to define margins, paddings, and flex properties very precisely just to make it look good. Bootstrap 5 made that process a lot easier. I no longer had to define classes myself because they were essentially bundled into pre-made classes. The best feature in my opinion was its grid system because it made accommodating for responsiveness easy. 

With my path from high school to college in web development, it goes to show how there is to learn about software development in general. I could go from thinking a certain way of writing code is the most efficient, just to learn about a new framework or extension that simplifies the process even further. This seems to apply to the development of technology throughout human history, like how AI was unfathomable a decade ago but now everyone has access to it. There is a lot to learn out there and I will always keep learning until I’ll be forced to discover something new myself.
