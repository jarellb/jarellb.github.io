The HEX Open Data Portal was a project I worked on that won 2nd place at the 2024 Hawaii Annual Code Challenge. This project strengthened my UI skills and introduced me to backend management and AI training.

We were given one month to improve the current [Hawaii Open Data Portal](https://opendata.hawaii.gov/) to be more organized, less clunky, and more user-friendly. We not only met the criteria, but innovated further with the implementation of graphs and charts for each dataset, an AI Chatbot that reads CSV files, and an interface for users to create and upload scientific reports for the world to see.

The project was implemented using Next.js, Firebase, Docker, and Flask. Over the course of 1 month, 

Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of reservations including flights, hotels, and car rentals.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming. 

Here is some example code to illustrate Simple Schema use:
